The world doesn't need another todo app. I'm pretty happy with how this came out but once I started trying to tackle log in (with Auth0) I realized this was more effort than I wanted to put in for a personal project. It was a good learning experience integrating Travis CI and Heroku. This was also my first project with persistence (saving task items in MongoDB Atlas) and that was not as painful as I was expecting.

If I were to start over again from the beginning I would probably look at AWS services (DynamoDB, lambda, etc) instead of disparate 3rd party services
